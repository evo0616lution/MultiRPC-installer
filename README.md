# MultiRPC-installer
A short and easy install script for MultiRPC
<b> Getting started </b>
<p> First, download MultiRPC from <a href="https://github.com/FluxpointDev/MultiRPC/releases/download/V7-beta4/multirpc_v7_linux.tar.gz"> this link </a>. </p>

Extract the file somewhere.

Then open the console in the folder where you just extracted the archive, and run following command: `git clone https://github.com/evo0616lution/MultiRPC-installer.git`

When done, you run this command: `sudo bash install.sh`.

Wait until it installs MultiRPC...

And then you're done, enjoy CustomRPC!
